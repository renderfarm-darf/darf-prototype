# The Role of the Curator

Hi! I’m the originator and curator of DARF. This repo represents a concept-first approach to distributed rendering. One that prioritizes user simplicity, low-barrier tools, and creative utility.

I’m not writing the backend code. My focus is on:

- Maintaining the vision and architecture for DARF
- Exploring workflows and testing UX assumptions
- Curating contributions to align with the project’s purpose

If you’re contributing code, I welcome experimentation—but please respect the conceptual scaffolding. DARF isn’t just about making something work, it’s about making something *worth sharing*.

Let’s build together—with intention.
