# 🎬 DARF  
_Distributed Android Render Farm_

Welcome to the framework that turns dormant devices into distributed render horsepower—quietly, respectfully, and on your terms.

**DARF** is not a renderer. It’s not a toy. It’s a mindset:
> _“We don't throw away compute. We organize it.”_

## 🧭 Start Here
The journey begins with logic—not rendering.

## 🔎 What DARF Gives You
- A file-based controller interface that defines frame tasks—not guesses them  
- An ethical, headless Android node model that protects devices from misuse  
- A zero-simulation Phase 1 discipline—because render pipelines should be designed, not improvised  
- A roadmap with non-negotiable boundaries. DARF doesn’t rush features—it earns them.

## 🧰 Who This Repo Is For
- Builders refining dispatch logic  
- Technicians validating payloads  
- Artists offloading renders to old phones  
- Developers who value structure over spectacle
