# 🚀 Getting Started with DARF

Welcome. Whether you're here to dispatch, contribute, or experiment, this is where your DARF journey begins.

DARF (Distributed Android Render Farm) is structured, ethical, and intentionally slow-moving. Phase 1 is already complete. We don't guess. We define.

## 🧱 Requirements

To get started, you’ll need:

- 🖥️ A desktop or laptop that can run Blender or better (Windows/Linux)
- 📦 Git and a basic terminal
- 📂 Comfort working with image sequences and static files
- 💾 At least one Android 7.0+ device (not used until Phase 2)
- 🧠 The discipline to follow boundaries—DARF is framework-first

No device flashing. No GPU requirements. No magic.
