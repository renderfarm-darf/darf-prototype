# 🤝 Contributing to DARF

Thank you for your interest in DARF (Distributed Android Render Farm). This project values clarity, ethics, and clean collaboration over velocity. We're not just building code—we're building trust.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

DARF moves slowly and intentionally. We prioritize:

- 🔍 Explicit payload definitions over automation
- ⚙️ Maintainable logic over one-time hacks
- 🔒 Device safety and thermal respect over “faster”
- 🧾 Open communication and ethical boundaries

Please read [`CURATOR.md`](../docs/CURATOR.md) for the non-negotiables that guide this project.

## 🧱 How to Contribute

### 💡 Code Contributions
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch
- Keep commits clean, scoped, and commented
- All public render code must respect node eligibility and safety
- If submitting Android renderers: **no GUI**, headless only

> Contributions without a clear phase alignment may be delayed.

---

### 🧪 Payload Testing or Scene Submissions
- Place test cases in `verified-scenes/` with a clear folder name
- Provide a minimal frame sequence or export path
- Keep all content **original or publicly licensed**
- Do not submit paid, proprietary, or NDA-restricted assets

---

### 📄 Documentation & Specs
- Want to contribute to `/docs`? Start by reading [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../docs/ROADMAP.md)
- Open issues or create PRs with spec proposals in markdown
- Never merge speculative future phases without discussion

## 🛠️ Questions Before You Code?

Open an issue, start a discussion, or drop a draft PR. We'd rather steer early than reject late.

Together, we build a respectful render mesh.

Welcome to DARF.
